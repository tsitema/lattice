# lattice

This project includes several tools for tight binding model calculations.
I built this to calculate coupled lasers but it can be used for any system that use tight binding approach.
It can calculate eigenvalues/vectors, time dependent fields, Arbitrary lattices with arbitrary dynamics.
There are also several functions for visualization in Static/Visual.m.
Two Matlab applications, GUI.mlapp and BHZGUI.mlapp shows two examples for next-nearest-neighbour coupled class B lasers and BHZ model with nonlinearity.
